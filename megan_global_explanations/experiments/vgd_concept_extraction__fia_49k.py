# == DATASET PARAMETERS ==
# The parameters determine the details related to the dataset that should be used as the basis 
# of the concept extraction

# :param VISUAL_GRAPH_DATASETS:
#       This determines the visual graph dataset to be loaded for the concept clustering. This may either 
#       be an absolute string path to a visual graph dataset folder on the local system. Otherwise this 
#       may also be a valid string identifier for a vgd in which case it will be downloaded from the remote 
#       file share instead.
VISUAL_GRAPH_DATASET: str = 'fia_49k'
# :param DATASET_TYPE:
#       This has the specify the dataset type of the given dataset. This may either be "regression" or 
#       "classification"
DATASET_TYPE: str = 'regression'
# :param CHANNEL_INFOS:
#       This dictionary can optionally be given to supply additional information about the individual 
#       explanation channels. The key should be the index of the channel and the value should again be 
#       a dictionary that contains the information for the corresponding channel.

# == MODEL PARAMETERS == 
# These parameters determine the details related to the model that should be used for the 
# concept extraction. For this experiment, the model should already be trained and only 
# require to be loaded from the disk

# :param MODEL_PATH:
#       This has to be the absolute string path to the model checkpoint file which contains the 
#       specific MEGAN model that is to be used for the concept clustering.

# == CLUSTERING PARAMETERS ==
# This section determines the parameters of the concept clustering algorithm itself.

# :param FIDELITY_THRESHOLD:
#       This float value determines the treshold for the channel fidelity. Only elements with a 
#       fidelity higher than this will be used as possible candidates for the clustering.
FIDELITY_THRESHOLD: float = 20
# :param MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE:
#       This parameter determines the min cluster size for the HDBSCAN algorithm. Essentially 
#       a cluster will only be recognized as a cluster if it contains at least that many elements.
MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE: int = 10
# :param MIN_SAMPLES:
#       This cluster defines the HDBSCAN behavior. Essentially it determines how conservative the 
#       clustering is. Roughly speaking, a larger value here will lead to less clusters while 
#       lower values tend to result in more clusters.
MIN_SAMPLES: int = 5

# == PROTOTYPE OPTIMIZATION PARAMETERS ==
# These parameters configure the process of optimizing the cluster prototype representatation

# :param OPTIMIZE_CLUSTER_PROTOTYPE:
#       This boolean flag determines whether the prototype optimization should be executed at 
#       all or not. If this is False, the entire optimization routine will be skipped during the 
#       cluster discovery.
OPTIMIZE_CLUSTER_PROTOTYPE: bool = False
# :param INITIAL_POPULATION_SAMPLE:
#       This integer number determines the number of initial samples that are drawn from the cluster 
#       members as the initial population of the prototype optimization GA procedure.
INITIAL_POPULATION_SAMPLE: int = 16
# :param OPENAI_KEY:
#       This string value has to be the OpenAI API key that should be used for the GPT-4 requests
#       that will be needed to generate the natural language descriptions of the prototypes.
OPENAI_KEY: str = os.getenv('OPENAI_KEY')
# :param DESCRIBE_PROTOTYPE:
#       This boolean flag determines whether the prototype description should be generated at all
#       or not. If this is False, the entire description routine will be skipped during the
#       cluster discovery.
