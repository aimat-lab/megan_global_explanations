    This is a mock implementation for testing purposes. This class is supposed to emulate the external interface of a 
    ``Megan`` model. Most importantly the ``forward_graphs`` method is supposed to be implemented such that it returns
    a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains keys that describe the output of the model regarding the 
    output of the model, the embeddings and the explanations. 
    
    Additionally to be used for testing the class also implements the ``save`` and ``load_from_checkpoint`` methods.
    These simply save the parameters of the constructor as a json format and then load it accordingly again.
